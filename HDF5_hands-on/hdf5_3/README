HDF5 Tutorial 3/3
=================

Start from the program you wrote for the exercice hdf5_2 (or the solution).

Extend the size of the original 2D dataset such that the slice from the 3D array can fit in the additinal space you allocate. 
Perform the partial IO that writes slice in this space instead of creating a dedicated dataset for the slice.
