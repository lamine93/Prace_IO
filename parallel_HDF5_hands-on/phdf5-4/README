Parallel HDF5 Tutorial 4/4
==========================

The available code is very similar to the one provided in phdf5-1. The difference is that each rank owns ghost cells at the borders of its domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. 
Examine the source code, compile and run it with 4 ranks:
make
llsubmit job_poincare


Examine the output files example.h5 with h5ls and h5dump command line tools. In this version, each rank exports its local data into its own separated file as in phdf5-1. 

Modify the program such that all the ranks write concurrently their data into a single dataset thanks to MPI-IO like phdf5-3.
